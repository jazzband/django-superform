0.3.1
-----

* ``SuperForm.composite_fields`` dict is not longer shared between form
  instances. Every new form instances get's a deep copy. So changes to it
  won't leak into other instances of the same form class.

-----

* `#11`_: Fix ``CompositeBoundField`` to allow direct access to nested form
  fields via ``form['nested_form']['field']``.
* Support for Django's Media handling in nested forms. See `#3`_ and `#5`_.
* Do not populate errorlist representations without any errors of nested
  formsets into the errors of the super form. See `#5`_ for details.
