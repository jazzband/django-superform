"""
This is awesome. And needs more documentation.

To bring some light in the big number of classes in this file:

First there are:

* ``SuperForm``
* ``SuperModelForm``

They are the forms that you probably want to use in your own code. They are
direct base classes of ``django.forms.Form`` and ``django.forms.ModelForm``
and have the formset functionallity of this module backed in. They are ready
to use. Subclass them and be happy.

Then there are:

* ``SuperFormMixin``
* ``SuperModelFormMixin``

These are the mixins you can use if you don't want to subclass from
``django.forms.Form`` for whatever reason. The ones with Base at the beginning
don't have a metaclass attached. The ones without the Base in the name have
the relevant metaclass in place that handles the search for
``FormSetField``s.


Here is an example on how you can use this module::

    from django import forms
    from django_superform import SuperModelForm, FormSetField
    from .forms import CommentFormSet


    class PostForm(SuperModelForm):
        title = forms.CharField()
        text = forms.CharField()
        comments = FormSetField(CommentFormSet)

    # Now you can use the form in the view:

    def post_form(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            form = PostForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
            if form.is_valid():
                obj = form.save()
                return HttpResponseRedirect(obj.get_absolute_url())
        else:
            form = PostForm()
        return render_to_response('post_form.html', {
            'form',
        }, context_instance=RequestContext(request))

And yes, thanks for asking, the ``form.is_valid()`` and ``form.save()`` calls
transparantly propagate to the defined comments formset and call their
``is_valid()`` and ``save()`` methods. So you don't have to do anything
special in your view!

Now to how you can access the instantiated formsets::

    >>> form = PostForm()
    >>> form.composite_fields['comments']
    <CommetFormSet: ...>

Or in the template::

    {{ form.as_p }}

    {{ form.composite_fields.comments.management_form }}
    {% for fieldset_form in form.composite_fields.comments %}
        {{ fieldset_form.as_p }}
    {% endfor %}

You're welcome.
